## Details
The project is portable and can be compiled on both Windows and Linux platforms. The class structure follows very close the famous Borland C++ Builder UI controls. The graphics engine is loose coupled with the controls and the interface can be used in stand alone applciations or inserted in existing game engines.

## History
The project's goal was to allow developers to create OpenGL UIs that looked similar to the desktop versions like OSX.

## Compatibility
Windows / Linux

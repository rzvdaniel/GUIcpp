An OpenGL user interface written in C++ some time ago. It is not maintained anymore and it's here for reference. It also has a twin brother (GUIsharp - https://github.com/rzvdaniel/GUIsharp) written in C#.

## Details
The project is portable and can be compiled on both Windows and Linux platforms. The class structure follows very close the famous Borland C++ Builder UI controls. The graphics engine is loose coupled with the controls and the interface can be used as stand alone applications or inserted in existing game engines.

## History
The project's goal was to allow developers to create OpenGL UIs that looked similar to the desktop versions like OSX.

## Compatibility
Windows / Linux
